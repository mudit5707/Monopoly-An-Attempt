# Monopoly-An-Attempt
It started off as an endeavor to build a playable Monopoly Game on Python, and ended in quitting :( 
It became too impractical and complex as I advanced with the coding, and so, I decided to keep this as an instance of COLOURING in Python, and not as a game!

## Some Notable Features:
- The Properties have been saved and printed in a tabulated form using MySQL.
- The Game Board is a grid that prints with colour coded numbers.
- The Player was supposed to be denoted with a coloured background, whose one small instance has been integrated.
- An error was made during coding, and a separate program was written for debugging the MySQL database

## Libraries Used:
- sys
- mysql
- tabulate
